Django A-matter is an application for authoring background biographical matter on newsworthy people. It is intended to be a copycat of MindTouch Deki pages like those published by WhoRunsGov.com_.

A-matter is newspaper slang for the background information common to many stories that can be written in advance of a news event_.

This application is in the early stages of development and shouldn't be expected to work.

Dependencies:
> python-dateutil
> django-places
> django-tagging
