h1. The Wishlist

* Write some generic URLS to illustrate basic pages
* Write some generic VIEWS for the same purpose
* Write some basic FEEDS for the latest additions
* Write a SITEMAP that plots everything out
* Write some basic TEMPLATES that illustrate ez layouts
* Decide which type of MARKUP to use in the admin
* Write tests for the MARKUP
* Write TEMPLATETAGS for a variety of lateral lists that might be nice (i.e. other people in a position, reverse-chron tenures for a person)
* Write tests for MUGSHOTS upload
* Write up some robust fixtures that can preload and show people how the app works. I think it should be in a load.py thing like geodjango demos.
