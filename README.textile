h1. django-a-matter

Django A-matter is an application for authoring background biographical matter on newsworthy people. It is intended to be a copycat of MindTouch Deki pages like those published by "WhoRunsGov.com":http://whorunsgov.com.

A-matter is newspaper slang for the background information common to many stories that can be written in advance of a news event_.

This application is in the early stages of development and shouldn't be expected to work.
